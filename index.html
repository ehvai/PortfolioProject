    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="block-format border-grey">
      <p>I am a Software Engineer looking to expand my experience and creative side.</p>
      <p>Living in Maryland affords a few interesting things such as:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Wait, you have seasons?  We have weather occurences.</li>
          <li>Living an hour from Washington, D.C., the Capital of the United States.</li>
          <li>Three hours from a beach, multiple states and some beautiful mountain trails.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>With the pandemic making a big change to how we live, work and relax, new opportunities arise in unique ways.  If you <a href="#contact">want to chat</a>, I am always available.</p>

     <h3>About Me</h3>
<!-- set the same format for the block of text and heading -->
    <div class="block-format border-grey">
    <p>Here are a few questions to get us started:
    </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Where were you born?</li>
    <p>I was born in Perth, Australia.</p>
    <li>Why are you pursuing education as a Software Engineer?</li>
    <p>Ever since the internet has been a thing, web pages have become more than just a list of links or words.  They have expanded to be a visual representation of an idea.  Devleoping a webpage is a way to showcase our creativity while allowing the logical side to get to work.</p>
    <li>Anything else you would like to share?</li>
    <p>Working alone on a project is great.  It feels good to get it done and know that you put in all the work for it.  What is even better, though, is working with a group of people and having that sense of accomplishment when it is done that you can share with your teammates.</p>
